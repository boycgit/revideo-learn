# Welcome to Revideo!

Revideo is an open-source framework for programmatic video editing. It lets you
create video templates in Typescript and provides an API to render these video
templates with dynamic inputs. It also provides a player component that you can
embed into your website to let users preview videos before exporting them to
mp4. Developers use Revideo to automate certain video editing tasks or to build
entire web-based video editors.

This project is often used as an MIT-licensed alternative to [Remotion](https://remotion.dev). Our rendering is currently
around 5x faster on the same hardware (and therefore 5x cheaper) than Remotion's, while also being easier to work
with when it comes to complex animations (we're of course biased here).

Revideo is forked from
[Motion Canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas), a code-based video-editor that
lets you create animations with code. Changes we've made to support our use-case include:

-   We've taken Motion Canvas' core animation engine and made it
    embeddable into front-end applications through a `<Player />` component.
-   Added performance optimizations to make rendering up to 50x faster
    when using videos inside your scenes.
-   Added headless rendering so you can render videos on the server.
-   Fixed a lot of bugs and added new features (as well as removed a lot of
    complexity from the original project).
